# Classification Algorithms on Heart Disease

## Overview

This notebook provides a practical guide to six popular classification algorithms used in machine learning. Classification is a vital task that involves assigning categories to observations based on their features.

## Algorithms Covered

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **Decision Trees Classifier**
5. **Random Forest Classifier**
6. **XGBoost Classifier**

## Use Case: Predicting Heart Disease

### Problem Definition

Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

## Installation

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
