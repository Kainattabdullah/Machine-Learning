# Linear Regression with Random Data

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of linear regression on randomly generated data using NumPy and Matplotlib. The dataset consists of a single feature \(X\) and a target variable \(y\) generated according to a linear equation with some added noise.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
