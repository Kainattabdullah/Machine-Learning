#  Implementation of Regression

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of regression techniques using the Iris dataset. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Contents
1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of the Iris dataset.
2. **Data Loading**
   - Loading the dataset using `sklearn.datasets`.
3. **Data Exploration**
   - Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
   - Printing feature and target names.
4. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Standardizing the features.
5. **Model Training**
   - Training a Linear Regression model.
   - Making predictions on the test set.
6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Calculating and displaying the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
7. **Using Pipelines**
   - Implementing a pipeline for preprocessing and K-Nearest Neighbors classification.
8. **Comparing Classifiers**
   - Training and evaluating K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree classifiers.
