# Lab 09: Machine Learning Techniques

This repository  demonstrates various machine learning techniques using Python and popular libraries such as Scikit-learn and Matplotlib. 

## Overview

The notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Softmax Function**
   - Implementation of the softmax function using logistic regression to classify iris flower species based on petal length and width.

2. **Holdout Method**
   - A demonstration of the holdout method for training and testing models on the UCI Zoo dataset using a Decision Tree Classifier.

3. **K-Fold Cross Validation**
   - An implementation of k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance on the MNIST digits dataset. It includes data visualization and accuracy evaluation.

4. **Model Evaluation Metrics**
   - Discussion on the use of accuracy, precision, and recall as metrics for evaluating model performance.
