#  Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the application of logistic regression to the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning. The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of the Iris dataset.
   - Explanation of the logistic regression model.

2. **Data Loading**
   - Import necessary libraries.
   - Load the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets`.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Display feature names and sample data.
   - Show target classes and their names.

4. **Data Preparation**
   - Prepare features (`X`) and target (`y`) for the logistic regression model.

5. **Model Training**
   - Fit a logistic regression model to the data.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Calculate and display the accuracy of the model.

7. **Visualization**
   - Plot the probabilities of the predictions to visualize the logistic regression output.
